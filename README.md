# Predicting Kaggle Competition Virality

This repository contains the Kaggle notebook used to analyze and predict the "virality" of Kaggle competitions based on features such as the number of participating teams, reward quantity, competition duration, and host segment.

## Project Overview

Competitions on Kaggle vary widely in participation. This project defines "viral" competitions as those in the top 20% by number of participating teams. Using historical competition data, a logistic regression model was built to predict whether a competition will be viral.

Key findings include:

- Higher rewards and longer competition durations correlate with higher participation.
- The hosting organization and competition category strongly influence virality.
- The logistic regression model achieves a balanced accuracy with good precision and recall.
